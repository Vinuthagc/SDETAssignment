8. Postman – API Testing (Positive & Negative Test Cases)
Postman is used to test RESTful APIs by sending HTTP requests and validating the server
responses. Both positive and negative scenarios are tested.
APIs Used:
GET : https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/5
POST : https://api.restful-api.dev/objects
PUT : https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/5
DELETE : https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/7
Positive Test Cases:
• GET – Retrieve existing object details (Status Code: 200)
• POST – Create new object (Status Code: 201)
• PUT – Update object details (Status Code: 200)
• DELETE – Delete object (Status Code: 200 / 204)
POST Request Body:
{
"name": "Mobile Phone",
"data": {
"year": 2024,
"price": 35000
}
}
Negative Test Cases:
• GET with invalid ID – 404 Not Found
• POST with empty body – 400 Bad Request
• PUT with invalid ID – 404 Not Found
• DELETE non-existing ID – 404 Not Found
Validation: HTTP Status Codes and response body are validated using Postman tests.
